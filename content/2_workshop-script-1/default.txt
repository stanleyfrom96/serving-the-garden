It means a lot to us.<br><br>We have thought carefully about how to approach the topic of the “server” in a way that goes beyond an extractivist perspective. Rather than seeing the server merely as a tool “for us,” we want to consider it as a shared space that requires nurturing.<br><br>When our group first tried to build a server, we found ourselves asking: What exactly is a server*? At that time, Asya gave us a simple yet clear answer: “The server is someone else’s computer.” In today’s meeting, we want to challenge the idea of accessing the server space by using the metaphor of a piece of land.<br><br>In this workshop “someone else’s computer” will be transformed into a collective garden, encouraging us to think aloud about what is shared, where it is, and how we can care for it.<br><br>By using this metaphor, we aim to avoid the constraints of programming language and make servers a more tangible space. Seeing the server as a garden also helps us raise questions about accessibility and needs.</p>"},"id":"35177488-59ac-4f04-a6fc-d3d681804da2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"How to access our server? ⁺₊⋆"},"id":"d17dc04d-882e-42a1-89d8-f3718383f5a5","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Log in to this WIFI ..

Quick, clever, and just a bit lazy, Pip loved taking shortcuts. Why work hard when there is an easier way?<br>Scene Narrator: Pip sits under a tree with a shiny red apple, its core tossed aside. The distant hum of silver towers echoes in the background.<br>Narrator: <em>(amused)</em> Pip’s favorite place was the big market at the edge of the forest — a land of silver towers humming softly under the sun, filled with rows of fruit, ripe and ready.<br>&gt;Pip:<em>(muttering, inspecting the empty apple core)</em> Strange... no seeds.<br>Scene Narrator: He tosses the core away and notices a flash of red fur in the distance.<br>Narrator: Curious as ever, Pip scurried toward the clearing, where a fox was digging in the dry soil.<br>Pip:(inquisitive) What are you doing?<br>Fox: (without looking up) Planting a seed.<br>Pip:<em>(chuckling)</em> Why bother? The market has all the fruit you’d ever need—no digging required!<br>Scene Narrator: The fox pauses, brushing dust from his nose, and points to the silver towers on the horizon.<br>Fox: The market’s fruit has no seeds, Pip. Without seeds, there’s no future. And without roots, nothing remembers.<br>Pip:<em>(skeptical)</em> What’s there to remember? It’s just fruit.<br>Fox: <em>(smiling knowingly)</em> Come back tomorrow. I’ll show you.<br><br>Scene Narrator: The clearing the next day. The fox places a seed into the dry soil, carefully covering it with dirt.<br>Pip:<em>(crossing his arms)</em> This will never work. The market is faster and easier.<br>Fox: <em>(gently)</em> The soil needs time to remember.<br>Pip:<em>(frowning) </em>Remember what?<br>Fox: That someone cared enough to plant a seed.<br>Narrator: Days pass. Pip grows frustrated, but one morning, he gasps at the sight of a tiny green sprout breaking through the soil.<br>Pip:<em>(excited)</em> It’s alive!<br>Fox: <em>(nodding)</em> The soil remembers.<br><br>Scene Narrator: More animals gather in the garden. The mole digs tunnels beneath the soil, the sparrow plants seeds, and the owl observes from above.<br>Mole: <em>(wiping dirt from her claws)</em> Roots need space to stretch—like making paths for wires underground.<br>Sparrow: <em>(chirping brightly)</em> More seeds mean stronger connections.<br>Narrator: As the garden grows, questions emerge.<br>Owl: Who decides what grows?<br>Mole: Who digs the deepest burrows?<br>Fox: And how do we make sure no one takes more than their share?<br>Scene Narrator: Voices overlap, arguments flare. The garden seems at risk of falling apart until the animals begin to listen.<br>Narrator: Under the shade of the tallest plants, the animals gathered in circles, sharing hopes and struggles.<br>Scene Narrator: The fox stands, holding a fruit.<br>Fox: This garden belongs to everyone who has cared for it—and everyone who will care for it. But care is not equal. Some bear a heavier weight. What matters is not avoiding the burden but learning to share it.<br>Scene Narrator: Silence falls. Faces thoughtful, the animals nod.<br>Owl: <em>(to Pip)</em> What does it mean to share care? Can it ever be fair?<br>Scene Narrator: Pip stares at the sprout, uncertain.<br><br>Scene Narrator: The garden in full bloom. Mole shows Pip the intricate web of roots beneath the soil.<br>Mole: <em>(reverently)</em> They remember every storm, every pawprint, every claw. They speak—not in words, but in how they grow together.<br>Pip: <em>(whispering)</em> What do they say?<br>Mole: They say, “Thank you.” But they also ask, “What will you do next?”<br>Scene Narrator: The camera lingers on Pip, staring at the roots as the garden thrives above.<br>Narrator: And so the question remains—not just for Pip, but for us all.<br>Narrator and everyone together: <em>(in unison, softly)</em> What will you do next? And who will you do it with?<br>(Fade to black.)</p>"},"id":"e4c908c0-43a6-4a7b-8380-ea2004c10eb1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"3ae6f94d-b294-403c-9c41-622a09e3e333","width":"1/1"}],"id":"6ed8d0e0-2f2a-447d-825d-a4fe3d27291f"},{"attrs":{"class":"","id":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":""},"id":"f824949b-7876-49bd-8290-d42d83f23100","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"ceca86ff-f624-4998-8457-6876ef459f0d","width":"1/1"}],"id":"687be4fd-7680-4916-88a5-19eb89b828c4"}]
