         <h2>Introduction ⁺₊⋆</h2>
         <p>
          Hi everyone,
          First of all, thank you for giving us the opportunity to divide our workshop into two parts. It means a lot to us.<br>
          <br>
          We have thought carefully about how to approach the topic of the “server” in a way that goes beyond an extractivist perspective. Rather than seeing the server merely as a tool “for us,” we want to consider it as a shared space that requires nurturing.<br>
          <br>
          When our group first tried to build a server, we found ourselves asking: What exactly is a server*? At that time, Asya gave us a simple yet clear answer: “The server is someone else’s computer.” In today’s meeting, we want to challenge the idea of accessing the server space by using the metaphor of a piece of land.<br>
          <br>
          In this workshop “someone else’s computer” will be transformed into a collective garden, encouraging us to think aloud about what is shared, where it is, and how we can care for it.<br>
          <br>
          By using this metaphor, we aim to avoid the constraints of programming language and make servers a more tangible space. Seeing the server as a garden also helps us raise questions about accessibility and needs.

        <h2>The Garden of Many Roots ❀ ⁺₊⋆</h2>

        <p>
            Scene Narrator: Description of the surrondings<br>
         arrator: A wise and thoughtful voice guiding the story.<br>
            Pip: A clever but lazy squirrel.<br>
            Fox: A patient and insightful character, dedicated to the garden.<br>
            Mole: A practical and hardworking digger, focused on the garden's foundation.<br>
            Sparrow: A cheerful and optimistic bird with a strong sense of community.<br>
            Owl: A thoughtful and wise observer who asks probing questions.<br>
            <br>
            Narrator: <i>(calm and reflective)</i> Once upon a time, in a forest not so far from here, there was a squirrel named Pip. Quick, clever, and just a bit lazy, Pip loved taking shortcuts. Why work hard when there is an easier way?<br>
  Scene Narrator: Pip sits under a tree with a shiny red apple, its core tossed aside. The distant hum of silver towers echoes in the background.<br>
  Narrator: <i>(amused)</i> Pip’s favorite place was the big market at the edge of the forest — a land of silver towers humming softly under the sun, filled with rows of fruit, ripe and ready.<br>
  >Pip:<i>(muttering, inspecting the empty apple core)</i> Strange... no seeds.<br>
  Scene Narrator: He tosses the core away and notices a flash of red fur in the distance.<br>
  Narrator: Curious as ever, Pip scurried toward the clearing, where a fox was digging in the dry soil.<br>
  Pip:<i></i>(inquisitive)</i> What are you doing?<br>
  Fox: (without looking up)</i> Planting a seed.<br>
  Pip:<i>(chuckling)</i> Why bother? The market has all the fruit you’d ever need—no digging required!<br>
  Scene Narrator: The fox pauses, brushing dust from his nose, and points to the silver towers on the horizon.<br>
  Fox: The market’s fruit has no seeds, Pip. Without seeds, there’s no future. And without roots, nothing remembers.<br>
  Pip:<i>(skeptical)</i> What’s there to remember? It’s just fruit.<br>
  Fox: <i>(smiling knowingly)</i> Come back tomorrow. I’ll show you.<br>
  <br>
  Scene Narrator: The clearing the next day. The fox places a seed into the dry soil, carefully covering it with dirt.<br>
 Pip:<i>(crossing his arms)</i> This will never work. The market is faster and easier.<br>
  Fox: <i>(gently)</i> The soil needs time to remember.<br>
  Pip:<i>(frowning) </i>Remember what?<br>
  Fox: That someone cared enough to plant a seed.<br>
  Narrator: Days pass. Pip grows frustrated, but one morning, he gasps at the sight of a tiny green sprout breaking through the soil.<br>
Pip:<i>(excited)</i> It’s alive!<br>
  Fox: <i>(nodding)</i> The soil remembers.<br>
  <br>
  Scene Narrator: More animals gather in the garden. The mole digs tunnels beneath the soil, the sparrow plants seeds, and the owl observes from above.<br>
  Mole: <i>(wiping dirt from her claws)</i> Roots need space to stretch—like making paths for wires underground.<br>
  Sparrow: <i>(chirping brightly)</i> More seeds mean stronger connections.<br>
  Narrator: As the garden grows, questions emerge.<br>
  Owl: Who decides what grows?<br>
  Mole: Who digs the deepest burrows?<br>
  Fox: And how do we make sure no one takes more than their share?<br>
  Scene Narrator: Voices overlap, arguments flare. The garden seems at risk of falling apart until the animals begin to listen.<br>
  Narrator: Under the shade of the tallest plants, the animals gathered in circles, sharing hopes and struggles.<br>
  Scene Narrator: The fox stands, holding a fruit.<br>
  Fox: This garden belongs to everyone who has cared for it—and everyone who will care for it. But care is not equal. Some bear a heavier weight. What matters is not avoiding the burden but learning to share it.<br>
  Scene Narrator: Silence falls. Faces thoughtful, the animals nod.<br>
  Owl: <i>(to Pip)</i> What does it mean to share care? Can it ever be fair?<br>
  Scene Narrator: Pip stares at the sprout, uncertain.<br>
  <br>
  Scene Narrator: The garden in full bloom. Mole shows Pip the intricate web of roots beneath the soil.<br>
  Mole: <i>(reverently)</i> They remember every storm, every pawprint, every claw. They speak—not in words, but in how they grow together.<br>
  Pip: <i>(whispering)</i> What do they say?<br>
  Mole: They say, “Thank you.” But they also ask, “What will you do next?”<br>
  Scene Narrator: The camera lingers on Pip, staring at the roots as the garden thrives above.<br>
  Narrator: And so the question remains—not just for Pip, but for us all.<br>
  Narrator and everyone together: <i>(in unison, softly)</i> What will you do next? And who will you do it with?<br>
  (Fade to black.)
